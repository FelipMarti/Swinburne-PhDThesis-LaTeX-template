We would like to thank Lennart Andersson for his feedback on this template.

We would also like thank Camilla Lekebjer for her contribution on this template, as well as Magnus Hultin for his popular science summary class and example document.

We would like to acknowledge Felip Mart\'{i} Carrillo for generating this template for our PhD thesis. Writing a thesis using a template is much easier.

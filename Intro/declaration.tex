\declaration{
Here is the place where you can declare all your goods when you enter into Australia. Don't forget to declare fruit, vegies and meat products.

I hereby declare that I have modified the Master's Thesis template of the Department of Computer Science at Lund University (where I did my final Master's Thesis) in order to design this Swinburne PhD Thesis template. I also have been inspired by the University of Cambridge PhD thesis template, by the PhD thesis of my supervisor, and the PhD thesis of my master's thesis supervisor.

In your PhD thesis you will have to write some like the next paragraph, ask your supervisor.

I hereby declare that except where specific reference is made to the work of 
others, the contents of this dissertation are original and have not been 
submitted in whole or in part for consideration for any other degree or 
qualification in this, or any other university. This dissertation is my own 
work and contains nothing which is the outcome of work done in collaboration 
with others, except as specified in the text and Acknowledgements. This 
dissertation contains a lot of words including appendices, 
bibliography, footnotes, tables and equations and has some figures.

\theabstract{
This document is a nice template that I have prepared for my Confirmation of Candidature. If everything goes well, I also will use it for my PhD thesis. 
This document is a modification of the Master's thesis template for theses carried out at the Department of Computer Science, Lund University. 

Your abstract should capture, in English, the whole thesis with focus on the problem and solution in 150 words. It should be placed on a separate right-hand page, with an additional \textit{1cm} margin on both left and right. Avoid acronyms, footnotes, and references in the abstract if possible.

Leave a \textit{2cm} vertical space after the abstract and provide a few keywords relevant for your report. Use five to six words, of which at most two should be from the title.
